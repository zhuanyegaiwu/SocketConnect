AndroidAsyncSocketExamples
==========================

This project includes a few examples on how to create different types of sockets using AndroidAsync. 
It includes examples for a TCP client/server, TCP client with SSL and UDP client/server.

To run the TCP/UDP client/server examples, just checkout the application and run it. For the TCP client using SSL it is first necessary to setup a TCP server using SSL and the trust manager should be set up correctly.
